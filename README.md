## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhim-123/study-buddy.git
cd study-buddy
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up your API key

Create a `.env` file in the repository root:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-gemini-api-key-here
```

> 🔑 Get your free Gemini API key at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

### 4. Run the app

**Option A — Double-click:**
```
run.bat
```

**Option B — Terminal:**
```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. Deploy on Vercel

This repo is now flattened for direct Vercel deployment. The root-level `app.py` is the Flask entrypoint, and the HTML files live beside it so Vercel can package the app without the extra nested folder.

### 6. Open in browser

```
http://localhost:5000
```

```

---

## 🔒 Security

- The `.env` file containing your API key is **excluded from git** via `.gitignore`
- The system prompt runs **server-side only** — never exposed to the browser
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized before being sent to the AI

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Upload your notes** (`.txt` file, max 2MB)
2. The notes are stored in the browser and sent with every request
3. The Flask backend injects your notes into the AI's system prompt
4. The AI **prioritizes your notes** but can also answer general knowledge questions
5. Switch between Chat, Podcast, Flashcards, Quiz, and Cross-Check modes anytime
