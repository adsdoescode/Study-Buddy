  STUDY BUDDY — Backend Server (the "brain" of the app)
==========================================================

Think of this file like the KITCHEN in a restaurant:
  - The customer (your browser) places an order (sends a message)
  - The kitchen (this server) takes that order to the chef (Gemini AI)
  - The chef cooks up a response
  - The kitchen sends the food (AI reply) back to the customer

To run this:
  1. Open a terminal / command prompt
  2. Type:  python app.py
  3. Open your browser to:  http://localhost:5000

That's it! 🎉

# =====================================================================
#  STEP 1: IMPORTS — Loading the tools we need
# =====================================================================
# Think of these like importing apps onto your phone.
# Each one gives us a specific superpower.

import os
# "os" lets us talk to the operating system — like reading files,
# checking environment variables (secret settings), etc.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, send_from_directory
# "Flask" is a tiny web server framework.
# - Flask        → creates our web server (like setting up a shop)
# - request      → lets us read what the browser sent us
# - jsonify      → converts Python dictionaries into JSON
#                   (JSON is the language browsers speak)
# - send_from_directory → sends files (like index.html) to the browser

from flask_cors import CORS
# "CORS" = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
# Without this, browsers block requests between different websites.
# We add it just in case — it makes things work smoothly.

from dotenv import load_dotenv
# "dotenv" reads a file called ".env" and loads its contents
# as environment variables. This is where we hide our API key
# so it doesn't get accidentally shared.

import google.generativeai as genai
# This is Google's official library to talk to Gemini AI.
# It handles all the complicated stuff — we just call simple functions.


# =====================================================================
#  STEP 2: LOAD THE SECRET API KEY
# =====================================================================
# The API key is like a password that lets us use Gemini AI.
# We store it in a file called ".env" so it stays private.

load_dotenv()
# ^ This reads the .env file and loads GEMINI_API_KEY into memory.

GEMINI_API_KEY = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY", "")
# ^ os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY", "") means:
#   "Go find a variable called GEMINI_API_KEY.
#    If you can't find it, just give me an empty string."

# If no key was found, print a helpful warning:
if not GEMINI_API_KEY:
    print("\n[WARNING] No GEMINI_API_KEY found!")
    print("   Create a file called  .env  in this folder and add:")
    print("   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here\n")

# Tell the Google library to use our API key for all future requests:
genai.configure(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)

# Hidden system prompt stored on the server only.
# If you want to change it, edit the .env file or this Python file.
SYSTEM_PROMPT = os.getenv(
    "STUDY_BUDDY_SYSTEM_PROMPT",
    "You are a helpful study buddy. Answer clearly, gently, and in simple language for a student. Always answer questions step by step. Number each step and include a short hint for the next step when appropriate."
)

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))


# =====================================================================
#  STEP 3: CREATE THE WEB SERVER
# =====================================================================
# This is like opening a shop. Flask creates a server that listens
# for visitors (browsers) and responds to their requests.

app = Flask(__name__, static_folder=".", static_url_path="")
# ^ Creates our Flask app.
#   static_folder="."  →  means "serve files from this same folder"
#   static_url_path="" →  means "don't add any prefix to file URLs"

CORS(app)
# ^ Enables CORS (explained above). Just a safety net.
